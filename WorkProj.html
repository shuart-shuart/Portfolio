	<meta name=description content="Hong Shu-ying 方舒颖 (b.1997, Singapore) is an artist working with metaphors she finds in sights, sounds and spaces familiar to her. 
	Informed by her lived experiences and growing up in Singapore, she enjoys a process-led method of working that often culminates into books or an ensemble of prints and videos. Her recent projects delve into informal archives that are either communal, personal, or a combination of both. She combines and collages found images and imageries.">
