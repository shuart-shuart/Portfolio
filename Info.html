	<meta name=description content="Hong Shu-ying 方舒颖 (b.1997, Singapore) is an artist working with metaphors she finds in sights, sounds and spaces familiar to her. 
	Informed by her lived experiences and growing up in Singapore, she enjoys a process-led method of working that often culminates into books or an ensemble of prints and videos. Her recent projects delve into informal archives that are either communal, personal, or a combination of both. She combines and collages found images and imageries.">

			<span style= "color:black;font-weight:500">Hong Shu-ying 方舒颖</span> (b.1997, Singapore) collects found images and traces of 
				the everyday as part of her research and artistic process. She considers the repetitions and contradictions within these 
				materials by reframing and sequencing them into books, moving images, and other printed matter.  
			</p><p>	
				Shu’s works act as reflections and time capsules, exploring alternative knowledge systems and manners of dissemination. 
				She values the everyday and the amateur creations, seeing these as earnest expressions of curiosity, creativity, and 
				dedication. This fascination is deeply rooted in her experiences growing up in amateur Chinese orchestras and consuming 
				user-generated content on the internet. Her recent projects delve into informal archives, such as handwritten elements 
				from scores and annotations, as well as amateur videos and images.  
			</p><p>	
				Beyond her artistic practice, Shu produces projects that expand the possibilities of show-making and encounters with art 
				and books, outside of purpose-build spaces. She is also one half of the collective Part Time Book Club alongside Mingli Seet.  
			</p><p>
				Shu was awarded the Kwek Leng Joo Prize of Excellence in Photography and was featured in the 6th Women in Film and 
				Photography Showcase by Objectifs Centre for Photography and Film (Singapore). Most recently, she presented two solo 
				exhibitions at Esplanade (Singapore) during Singapore Art Week 2024 and Yao Alternative Space (Taiwan). Her work has been 
				showcased internationally in exhibitions, festivals, and showcases across Austria, Cambodia, China, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, 
				Malaysia, the Netherlands, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. Shu holds a BFA (Hons) in Media Art (Photography) from Nanyang 
				Technological University's School of Art, Design, and Media.
