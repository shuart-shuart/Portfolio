			<span style= "color:black;font-weight:500">Hong Shu-ying 方舒颖</span> (b.1997, Singapore) is an artist who 
				collects and works with found images and materials to highlight patterns, repetitions, and contradictions 
				related to inheritance and ways of learning. She recontextualises familiar sights and sounds as metaphors 
				through process-led methods of observation and research.
			</p><p>
				In her recent projects, Shu delves into informal archives that are often both personal and communal. 
				These include collections of handwritten scores, user-generated content such as YouTube videos, and
				digitised books. These archives function like time capsules, encapsulating the banalities and 
				peculiarities of life, bearing witness to traces of imaginations and impressions. This fascination is 
				informed by her experiences as a second-generation migrant and playing in amateur Chinese orchestras.
			</p><p>	
				Shu holds a BFA (Hons) in Media Art (Photography) from Nanyang Technological University, School of 
				Art, Design, and Media. She was awarded the Kwek Leng Joo Prize of Excellence in Photography and 
				featured in the 6th Women in Film and Photography Showcase by Objectifs (Singapore). She recently 
				had her first solo presentation at Esplanade (Singapore) as part of the Singapore Art Week 2024. She 
				has participated in exhibitions, showcases, and festivals in Singapore, Cambodia, China, Germany, 
				Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, South Korea, and Thailand.
