			<span style="font-style:italic">Kya Kya (走走)</span> introduces new ways of interaction between 
			me and my father. Over a series of collaborative photoshoots, we spent time together and exchanged 
			personal memories and thoughts. The process of sharing, location scouting, and shooting differed 
			from our usual modes of interaction. While engaging in nostalgia, the new excursions also fostered 
			new memosries. Kya kya-- a Hokkien phrase my dad uses affectionly for leisurely walks, captures 
			this state of mind.
			</p><p>
			This work is a part of a continual attempt to negotiate my relationship with my father. I felt it 
			was important and powerful for co-subjects to be co-authors too. I sought a new form of working 
			that incorporated his contributions and opinions while keeping private. Instead of specific memories, 
			we focused on different places associated with our relationship. By writing riddles about these places, 
			we were able to share our opinions and thoughts. On location, we took turns to direct or assist for 
			each other's images. We often spent three to four hours at each place, exploring and expanding on 
			earlier conversations.
			</p><p>
			My father and I have a complicated relationship, but I value it a lot. We struggle to communicate 
			in an open and safe space, and I struggled to articulate the contradictions in our relationship. 
			Amidst all the confusion, fear and indignance navigating our relationship, I came to accept that 
			these fallibilities. Maybe there’s no way to “fix” this because it is what it is, and it will continue 
			to be. By sharing this work, I acknowledge the differences and irrationality in parent-child 
			relationships. Perhaps, it is more meaningful to renew ways of interaction and let go of past baggage 
			to focus on building the relationship.
