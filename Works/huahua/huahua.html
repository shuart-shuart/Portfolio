		<span id="title">划画·画划 Exercises in Excision </span> delves into the narrative potential of music. Drawing inspiration from Chinese Orchestra 
		scores and music, notably Liu Tianhua's <i>空山鸟语</i> (Birdsongs in the Vacant Valley). The visual elements of the installation give prominence to 
		the notations marked by prior performers and dissonance from repeated photocopying of the scores – indicative of how often they’d been replicated 
		for sharing. Aurally, the work echoes music’s desire to mimic nature, and the human desire for connection and communication. 
		</p>
		<p>Confounded by the spectrum of emotions associated with flesh and meat, Shu-ying explores how images of flesh and meat are made and utilised in 
		<i>划画·画划 Exercises in Excision.</i>
		</p>

		<p>
		In <i>划画 Exercises</i> (translated as cut-up images), Shu photographs and reimagines Wong Keen’s flesh sculptures from the series Forest. 
		Masqueraded as seductively beautiful layers of colours and paper forms, Wong’s candid studies of our desires towards flesh and meat belie the 
		violent and visceral at first glance. This uneasy coexistence echoes the thin line between meat and flesh.
		</p>

		<p>
		Wong's sculptural paintings are re-presented as flattened images again through photography. The focus shifts to specific textures while the 
		surrounding visuals melt into blurs of colours in an ambiguous space, much like how our ideals of flesh and meat are often disembodied or removed 
		from context.
		</p>

		<p>
		In <i>画划 Excisions</i> (translated as imaging the gash), Shu creates abstract compositions from her personal archive of ultrasound scans from an 
		excision biopsy. In contrast with languages of care and notions of physical wellness, intrusive and aggressive medical procedures often feel violent 
		and disorientating. What do we make of these trimmings of ourselves that are removed, not for consumption but for health; do we see them as flesh or 
		meat?
		</p>

		<p>
		The collaged scans possess an obscure and cryptic quality, appearing serene and sinuous at first glance; yet this is disrupted by traces of medical 
		imaging. This juxtaposition of the natural-looking monochromatic forms with crosses, gradients and grids in colour creates tension that challenges 
		the wholesomeness of these images.
		</p>

		<p>
		These exercises of reimagining different images of flesh and meat further excise the imaged bodies, serving as a reminder that they were once part 
		of living entities. How are flesh and bodies rendered through the eyes of an artist and the lenses of medical devices?
