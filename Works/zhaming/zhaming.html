	<meta name=description content="Hong Shu-ying 方舒颖 (b.1997, Singapore) is an artist working with metaphors she finds in sights, sounds and spaces familiar to her. 
	Informed by her lived experiences and growing up in Singapore, she enjoys a process-led method of working that often culminates into books or an ensemble of prints and videos. Her recent projects delve into informal archives that are either communal, personal, or a combination of both. She combines and collages found images and imageries.">

		What other signifiers of time are there beyond the standardised units of years, days, hours, minutes and seconds that we are so used to? I remember this phrase "日出而作 日落而息“ which translates to work when the sunrises, rest when the sunsets; I found it so elegant that this phrase from a folk song in the Yao period said so much about how in sync the people were with their environment then and the harmonious relationship they shared with nature. This work takes from field recordings and found recordings to create a cacophony of bird sounds as an alternative way to document and signal the start of a day.		</p>
