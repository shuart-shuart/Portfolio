			<p>Singapore as “garden city” is a vision that has been ongoing for more than half a century since 1967. 
		      This was another of MM Lee Kwan Yew's legacy - to manicure our island into a neat tapestry of plants 
		      with low maintenance and high visual impact.
			<!--<br><br>
		      While many plants have been replaced as our nation’s branding focus and urban planning resources evolved, 
		      the bougainvillaea has remained. The plant is most recognisable for its garish shades of pink and magenta. 
		      Its leaves are often mistaken for flowers, and origins often assumed to be native to Singapore or the region. 
			<br><br>
		      The bougainvillaea’s hardiness and ability to bloom all year round has assured its longstanding presence. 
		      They can be trained to grow as a tree or creeper, in pots or on the ground. This flexibility and ease of 
		      growth made it a popular ornamental plant and choice for topiaries. The plant was discovered in Brazil by 
		      French navigator, Louis Antoine de Bougainville, back in the 18th century.
			<br><br>
		      In this series, I take a closer look at the plant and ponder over its prominence in our local landscape. 
			<br><br>
		      They represent Singapore's pragmatism.<br>
		      They represent our microwave approach to building up a tourism industry.<br>
		      They represent our desire to compensate for the Formosa this island once was.<br>
			<br>
		      They are assumed to be local, like how we assume we own the land we stand on.<br>
		      They are stop-gap measures that have overstayed, like the restrictions and regulations in our laws and social mores.<br>
		      They are the garish fuchsia stain that we can't wash off our skin.<br>
		      <br>--- <br><br>
		      The images are diptychs portraits of the Bougainvillea. The individual photos are cropped to the 7:9 ratio of Singapore 
		      passport photos. On the left are images of GoogleMap screenshots, an indirect catalogue of the plant in Singapore. And, on 
		      the right are high-definition images of the “flowers”, the visual quality recalls spectres of photograms and pressed flowers.

			<p>The first part of this ongoing series takes an affectionate look at the bougainvillea plant and how things are in Singapore's landscape. With all its qualities and prominence, can the bougainvillea be our "national flower"?</p>
